# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

We attempted to build a chat bot. The bot doesn't serve any particular overarching purpose, but it does answer some cs98-related questions.

We used a variety of Azure web services, including LUIS, LUDown, ChatDown, QNAMaker and Azure Bot.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Sud followed the first 5 videos of the tutorial, which included setting up the dev environment and setting up the basics of a chat bot.
Mack followed the sixth video, at which point it became clear the tutorial was in part deprecated. Mack pivoted and continued implementing the bot using Microsoft's interface, rather than through the CLI/manually creating json files, etc.

## What you learned

We know have a much stronger understanding of what intents and entities are in NLP. Overall, this was mostly an experience in adapting tutorials when they are deprecated.
